\label{chap:methods_dev}
%\section{Overview/meta-text}

In this Chapter, I will outline the rationale and development of various methods used throughout this thesis to examine \glspl{synthetic lethal} in \gls{gene expression} data, \glslink{graph}{graph} structures, models and simulations. First by describing the \acrfull{SLIPT}, a \gls{bioinformatics} approach to triage of \gls{synthetic lethal} candidate genes. This is considered one of the main research outputs of the thesis, which is supported by comparisons to an experimental screen from a related project and performance on simulated data. These supporting data will be covered in further chapters but preliminary data to support the use and design of \gls{SLIPT} are provided alongside description of the method. This includes the construction of a statistical model of \glspl{synthetic lethal} in (continuous multivariate Gaussian) \gls{gene expression} data, which enables testing \gls{SLIPT} upon simulated data with known \gls{synthetic lethal} partners. Another key component of the simulation pipeline used later is the generation of simulated data from a known \glslink{graph}{graph} structure or simulated biological pathway. The development of this simulation procedure and other statistical \gls{treatment} of graph and \glslink{graph}{network} structures will also be covered. Various R packages have been developed to support this project, most notably the \texttt{slipt} package to implement the \gls{SLIPT} methodology. The additional R packages for handling \glslink{graph}{graph} structures, simulations, and custom plotting features will also be described as research outputs of this thesis, methods applied throughout, and contributions to the open-source software community that made this project feasible.

\section{A Synthetic Lethal Detection Methodology} \label{methods:SLIPT}
%\subsection{Rationale and Design of Test}
%\subsection{Synthetic Lethal Detection Method}

The \gls{SLIPT} methodology identifies \gls{gene expression} patterns consistent with \gls{synthetic lethal} interactions between a query gene and a panel of candidate interacting partners. \Gls{gene expression} is called low, medium, or high by separating samples into tertiles (3-quantiles) for each gene. Genes with insufficient \glslink{gene expression}{expression} across all samples were excluded by requiring that the first tertile of raw counts is above zero. Then a $\chi^2$ test is performed between the query gene and each candidate partner, with the p-values for the $\chi^2$ test being corrected for multiple testing using \gls{FDR} error control to reduce false positives for large candidate gene panels \citep{fdr1995}. Significance was called only if \gls{FDR} adjusted p-values were below the threshold $p < 0.05$. A \gls{synthetic lethal} interaction is predicted  (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SLIPT_Method}) when (i) the $\chi^2$ test is significant; (ii) observed low-query, low-candidate samples are less frequent than expected; and (iii) observed low-query, high-candidate and high-query, low-candidate samples are more frequent than expected.

   \caption[Framework for \gls{synthetic lethal} prediction]{\small \textbf{Framework for \gls{synthetic lethal} prediction.} \gls{SLIPT} was designed to identify candidate interacting genes from \gls{gene expression} data using the $\chi^2$ test against a query gene. Samples are sorted into low, medium, and high \glslink{gene expression}{expression} quantiles for each gene to test for a directional shift. A sample being low in both genes of a \gls{synthetic lethal} pair is unlikely, since loss of both genes will be deleterious, and is expected to be statistically under-represented in a \gls{gene expression} dataset. We expect a corresponding (symmetric) increase in frequency of sample with low-high gene pairs. \Gls{synthetic lethal} candidate (exprSL) partners of a gene are identified by running this procedure on all possible partner genes, selecting those with an \gls{FDR}-adjusted $\chi^2$ p-value of $p < 0.05$, and meeting the directional criteria. Since \gls{synthetic lethal} genes are partners of each other commutatively, the symmetric direction criteria are all required such that \gls{synthetic lethal} genes will predicted to be partners of each other.

\end{figure*}


The \gls{synthetic lethal} prediction procedure has also been adapted to utilise \gls{somatic} \gls{mutation} data for the query gene. This is intended to utilise a query gene known to be recurrently mutated in the disease (and dataset), with the majority of \glspl{mutation} inactivating gene function (e.g.,  null or frameshift \glspl{mutation}). A \gls{synthetic lethal} interaction is predicted  (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SLIPT_Method_mtSL}) when (i) the $\chi^2$ test is significant; (ii) observed \gls{mutant}-query, low-candidate samples are less frequent than expected; and (iii) observed \gls{mutant}-query, high-candidate and \gls{wild-type}-query, low-candidate samples are more frequent than expected. Unless otherwise specified, computationally predicted \gls{synthetic lethal} gene candidates from \gls{SLIPT} used \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data (exprSL) for both genes (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SLIPT_Method}) rather than \gls{mutation} data (mtSL) for the query gene (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SLIPT_Method_mtSL}).

Samples are sorted into low, medium, and high \glslink{gene expression}{expression} quantiles for each candidate gene and tested for a directional shift against \gls{mutation} status of the query gene. A sample having low \glslink{gene expression}{expression} or \gls{mutation} for the \gls{synthetic lethal} pair is expected to be unlikely with a corresponding increase in frequency of sample with \gls{mutant}-high or \gls{wild-type}-low gene pairs. \Gls{synthetic lethal} candidate (mtSL) partners of a gene are identified by running this procedure on all possible partner genes, selecting those with an \gls{FDR}-adjusted $\chi^2$ p-value of $p < 0.05$, and meeting the directional criteria. %Synthetic lethal genes are partners of each other commutatively with \gls{synthetic lethal} genes will predicted to be partners of each other.

The \gls{SLIPT} methodology is amenable for use on \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data including pathway \glspl{metagene} (as generated in Section~\ref{methods:metagene}). The suitability of the \gls{SLIPT} methodology to application on public \gls{gene expression} data will further be supported by simulation results in Section~\ref{chapt2:simulation_2015} and Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation}, including comparison to other statistical methods. \gls{SLIPT} results for \textit{CDH1} will also compared experimental screen results in a breast cell line \citep{Telford2015}, primary screen results are discussed in Section~\ref{chapt3:compare_SL_genes} and secondary (validation) screen results are presented in Appendix~\ref{chapt3:secondary_screen}.

%This methodology was adapted to used pathway \gls{metagene} quantiles rather than \gls{gene expression} as an input for pathway \glspl{synthetic lethal} testing. The p-values for $\chi^2$ tests were also corrected for multiple testing with the false positive rate \citep{fdr1995} across all pathways tested from the same database and with significance defined as a \gls{FDR} adjusted p-values $p < 0.05$ as above.

%mtSLIPT method
%A similar methodology was developed in both cases to test for \glspl{synthetic lethal} where the query gene has an inactivating \gls{mutation} in some patients. Since most \glspl{mutation}, particularly in \gls{tumour suppressor} genes, are deleterious all \gls{somatic} non-synonymous \glspl{mutation} were counted as \gls{mutant} and \glspl{synthetic lethal} was tested with the query gene changed accordingly (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mtSLIPT_Method}. To distinguish these methods they are abbreviated to exprSLIPT and \acrshort{mtSLIPT} respectively depending on the molecular property used to define low gene activity of the query gene.

\section{Synthetic Lethal Simulation and Modelling} \label{methods:simulation_SL_expression} 

A statistical model of Synthetic Lethality was developed to generate simulated data to test the \gls{SLIPT} procedure. This section will describe the \gls{synthetic lethal} model and the simulation procedure for generating \gls{gene expression} data with known \gls{synthetic lethal} partners. Some preliminary results to support usage of the \gls{SLIPT} methodology throughout this thesis will be presented here. The simulation procedure will be applied in more depth in Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation}, including in combination with simulations from \glslink{graph}{graph} structures.

\subsection{A Model of Synthetic Lethality in Expression Data} \label{methods:SL_Model}

A conceptual model of \glspl{synthetic lethal} was constructed (see Figure~\ref{fig:SL_Model}), which will be used to build a statistical model of \gls{synthetic lethal} \gls{gene expression} from which to simulate \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data to on which test SLIPT and various potential \gls{synthetic lethal} prediction methods. In the model, \glspl{synthetic lethal} arises between genes with related functions as a cell death phenotype when these functions are removed.

   \caption[A model of \gls{synthetic lethal} \gls{gene expression}]{\small \textbf{A model of \gls{synthetic lethal} gene expresion.} A conceptual model of \gls{synthetic lethal} interactions between a Query gene and partner gene ($G_X$). Genes that are \gls{synthetic lethal} may not both be non-functional in the same sample without another gene compensating for the loss of function. This is most likely to be detectable as low \gls{gene expression}, whether they are lost by \gls{mutation}, deletion, \acrshort{DNA} methylation, or suppressing regulatory signals. This could manifest as coexpression, mutual exclusivity, or directional shifts in sample frequency. Thus the alternative hypothesis ($H_{A}$) is that \gls{synthetic lethal} genes will have a reduced frequency of co-loss samples while the null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) is that non-synthetic lethal gene pairs would show no such relationship, even if they may be correlated for other means such as pathway relationships. In this model \gls{synthetic lethal} genes may compensate for the loss of each other but this is not assumed, only that loss of both is unfavourable to cell viability and probability of detecting samples with combined gene loss.
}
\label{fig:SL_Model}
%\end{mdframed}
\end{figure*}


This model suggests that \glspl{synthetic lethal} is detectable in measures of gene inactivation across a sample population, namely \gls{mutation}, \acrshort{DNA} \gls{copy number}, \acrshort{DNA} methylation, and suppression of \glslink{gene expression}{expression}. While any of these mechanisms of gene inactivation could lead to \glspl{synthetic lethal}, \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data is readily available and changes in these alternative mechanisms are likely to impact on the amount of expressed (functional) \acrshort{RNA} or protein detectable. There are several ways that functional relationships between genes could manifest in \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data, including coexpression, mutual exclusivity and directional shifts. Co-expression is overly simplistic and has previously performed poorly as a predictor of \glspl{synthetic lethal} \citep{Jerby2014}, although this will still be tested with correlation measures in later simulations. Here the alternative hypothesis is that \glspl{synthetic lethal} will lead to a detectable directional shift in the number of samples exhibiting low or high \glslink{gene expression}{expression} of either gene. This model does not preclude mutual exclusivity \citep{Wappett2016}, compensating \glslink{gene expression}{expression} or co-loss under-representation \citep{Lu2015} as previously postulated to occur between \gls{synthetic lethal} genes. 

The first condition of the \gls{synthetic lethal} model is that if there are only two \gls{synthetic lethal} genes (e.g., \textit{CDH1} and one SL partner), then they will not both be non-functional in the same sample (in an ideal model). Gene function is thus determined for each sample in a model of \gls{synthetic lethal} with the proportion of samples with a functional or non-functional gene being arbitrary. Whether a gene is functional can similarly be modelled by an arbitrary threshold of continuous and normally distributed \gls{gene expression} data to define gene function (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SL_Model_Expression}). For the purposes of modeling \glspl{synthetic lethal} in breast cancer \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data, a threshold of the 30\textsuperscript{th} percentile of the \glslink{gene expression}{expression} levels was used because approximately 30\% of samples analysed had \textit{CDH1} inactivation. This was generalised for a model of the proportion of samples inactivated for each gene. In this ideal case, no samples lowly expressing both of these genes are expected to be observed. While this is not observed, that is to be expected as it is unlikely that only 2 genes will have an exclusive \gls{synthetic lethal} partnership. The threshold of the 0.3 quantile was used in simulations dervied from this model throughout this thesis.

Expression below a threshold is used as a model of loss of function, where genes are regarded as non-functional for the purposes of modelling \glspl{synthetic lethal}. Tumour suppressor genes with loss of function also have cancer specific phenotypes (although these thresholds are not necessarily the same). Expression is modeled by a normally (Gaussian) distributed continuous data such as (log-scale) data from \acrshort{RNA} (\gls{microarray} or \acrshort{RNA}-Seq), protein, or pathway \glspl{metagene}. This rationale generalises for several genes on a multivariate normal distribution.

Consider interactions between a Query gene and two partner genes ($G_X$ and $G_Y$). They may interact with the Query pairwise (inviable when either gene pair is lost) or form a higher-order interaction such as the ``synthetic lethal triplet''  if any of the genes provide an \gls{essential} function (inviable only when all are lost). Either is plausible with the potential \glslink{graph}{pathway} structures. A \gls{synthetic lethal} triple has 8 potential combinations of gene functional but one is not expected to be observed (due to inviability) but pairwise inactivation may be observed if additional partner genes are functional. The proportion of these combinations vary depending on the functional threshold.
}
\label{fig:SL_Model_Higher}
%\end{mdframed}
\end{figure*}



A \gls{synthetic lethal} pair of genes is unlikely to act in isolation, therefore higher-order \gls{synthetic lethal} interactions (i.e., 3 or more genes) must be considered in the model as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SL_Model_Higher}. Even when testing pairwise interactions, modelling higher level interactions that may interfere is important. If there are additional \gls{synthetic lethal} partners, there are two possibilities for adding these: 1) that they are independent partners of the query genes interacting pairwise (and not with each other) or 2) that an addition partner gene interacts with both of the \gls{synthetic lethal} genes already in the system and any of the three (or more) are required to be functional for the cell to survive.

The signal (in terms of \gls{gene expression} data) will be weaker for this latter case and this model has the more stringent assumption that all \gls{synthetic lethal} partner genes interact with each other: that only one of these must be expressed to satisfy the model of \glspl{synthetic lethal}. In this model any of the \gls{synthetic lethal} genes in a higher-order interaction is able to provide the missing function of the others, allowing for higher-level \gls{synthetic lethal} partners to compensate for loss a \gls{synthetic lethal} gene pair. While samples expressing low levels of the \gls{synthetic lethal} gene pairs will be under-represented, they may not be completely absent from the dataset due to these higher-level interactions.

In the example of 3 \gls{synthetic lethal} genes~\ref{fig:SL_Model_Higher}, only one of genes involved in the higher-order \gls{synthetic lethal} interaction is required for cell viability. For \gls{synthetic lethal} pairs, only a subset of these samples will be inviable (i.e., removed from simulated data), leading to an under-representation.

In practice, samples are not removed from a simulated dataset, rather the \glslink{gene expression}{expression} and function of the query gene is generated across samples separately from the pool of potential partner genes. The query gene data is matched to simulated samples (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulate_add_query}), satisfying the \gls{synthetic lethal} condition with the procedure described in Section~\ref{methods:simulating_SL}. This is performed to maintain a comparable samples size across simulations and the preserve the assumed (multivariate) normal distribution of the data.

\subsection{Simulation Procedure} \label{methods:simulating_SL}

Simulations were developed to simulate normal distributions of \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data and define function with a threshold cut-off. This is the reverse to the procedure of \gls{SLIPT} to predict \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (although the threshold is assumed to be unknown when testing upon simulated data). While gene function is used as an intermediary step in modelling \gls{synthetic lethal} genes in \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data, the normal distribution is sampled for simulated data to represent normalised empirical \gls{gene expression} data for which \gls{SLIPT} (and other methods) will be applicable.

Sampling a distribution for \glslink{gene expression}{expression} profiles has the added advantage of being amenable to simulating correlation structures with the multivariate normal distribution (using the \texttt{mvtnorm} R package \citep{Genz2009, mvtnorm}). The parameter $\Sigma$ is a covariance matrix defines the correlation structure between simulated genes being sampled. With a diagonal of one, this $\Sigma$\ matrix simulates genes with a standard deviation of one and the covariance parameters between them are the correlations between each gene. In Figure~\ref{fig:simulate_function}, an example of such a simulated multivariate normal dataset is shown with the functional threshold applied.

Once we have generated a simulated dataset, the samples are compared by gene function (as derived from a functional threshold). Known underlying \gls{synthetic lethal} partners are selected within the dataset and a query gene is generated by sampling from the normal distribution. These are matched (as shown for 2 \gls{synthetic lethal} partners in Figure~\ref{fig:simulate_add_query}) such that the \gls{synthetic lethal} condition is met: that at least one of the synthetic partner genes and the query gene are functional in any particular cell. The samples are ordered by functional data (without assuming correlation of underyling \glslink{gene expression}{expression} values) with the query gene in one direction and the remaining dataset ordered by the selected \gls{synthetic lethal} partner.

This results a simulated dataset where samples with non-functional query gene have at least one functional partner gene. Similarly, the query gene is functional in all samples where all of the \gls{synthetic lethal} partner genes are non-functional. Therefore a dataset has been generated with known \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (see Figure~\ref{fig:simulate_SL}) by as few assumptions about the relationships between the each \gls{synthetic lethal} pair as possible (and allowing compensating functions from higher-order interactions). This has been designed to have the most stringent (least detectable) \gls{synthetic lethal} relationships where higher-order interactions are possible for the purposes of testing pairwise detection procedures such as \gls{SLIPT}.

\section{Detecting Simulated Synthetic Lethal Partners} \label{chapt2:simulation_2015}

The \gls{synthetic lethal} detection methodology (\gls{SLIPT}), as described in Section~\ref{methods:SLIPT}, was tested on simulated data with known \gls{synthetic lethal} partners, generated using the procedure described in Section~\ref{methods:simulating_SL}. This section will present basic simulations to demonstrate the methodology and support its use throughout this thesis. These will be performed with sampling from basic statistical distributions as described, including multivariate normal distribution with correlated blocks of genes, with the $\Sigma$ matrix show in the plots where relevant. A more complex multivariate normal sampling procedure based on pathway \glslink{graph}{graph} structures, as described in section ~\ref{methods:graphsim}, will be applied in Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation}. 

\subsection{Binomial Simulation of Synthetic Lethality} \label{chapt2:simulation_binom}
%[relevant?]


A previous version of the \gls{synthetic lethal} simulation procedure (described in Section~\ref{methods:simulating_SL}), used gene function sampled directly from a binomial distribution using the binomial probability of observing functional gene levels ($p = 0.3$) in one observation ($n = 1$) for each samples: $$X\sim Bin(n,p)$$  Once a query gene consistent with \glspl{synthetic lethal} has been added, these functional levels were passed directly into \gls{SLIPT} as ``low'' and ``high'' categories.

The simulation procedure was performed with 20,000 total genes (as feasible in the human \glspl{genome} and \glslink{gene expression}{expression} datasets) with a variable number of true \gls{synthetic lethal} partners and sample sizes of 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000. Each \{gls{ROC} curve was derived from the results of 10,000 replicate simulations. The statistical performance (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Binomial_AUC}) of such an approach based on the $\chi^2$ p-value declines towards random predictions (an \{gls{AUROC} of 0.5) with an increasing number of underlying true \gls{synthetic lethal} partners to detect. However, increased sample size mitigates this decline to some extent, as expected with a statistical predictor, particularly for moderate numbers of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners.

%\end{mdframed}
\end{figure*}

Simulations based on a simple binomial model of \glspl{synthetic lethal} are limited but form a basis for builing a more complex model including \glslink{gene expression}{expression} and correlation structures. While this does not represent the data that \gls{SLIPT} will be applied to, binomial simulations do demonstrate that \gls{SLIPT} is able to distinguish small numbers of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners in a simplistic simulated system with behavious expected with resepect to sample size. This supported further development of the \gls{synthetic lethal} model and simulation pipeline (as described in Section~\ref{methods:simulation_SL_expression}) using the multivariate normal distribution.

The multivariate normal simulation procedure is more representative of the (normalised) \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data \gls{SLIPT} is intended for and enables the prediction procedure to be tested without changes to the methodology (presented in more detail in Section~\ref{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm}). Sampling continuous \glslink{gene expression}{expression} values from a normal distribution allows the \glslink{gene expression}{expression} threshold for gene function to differ from the categorical ``low'' and ``high'' \glslink{gene expression}{expression} binning performed by \gls{SLIPT} (as discussed in Section~\ref{methods:SL_Model}) which represents that the \gls{SLIPT} procedure does not assume a known threshold for \glslink{gene expression}{expression} but rather uses \glslink{gene expression}{expression} as an estimate of gene function. This functionality can be included in the multivariate normal simulation without compromising the statistical performance of the \gls{SLIPT}, rather the performance estimates (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Binomial_Compare}) were a marked improvement over the binomial simulation procedure across simulation parameters in an equivalent simulation (without correlation structure). This imprivement may be due to binomial model defining the \gls{synthetic lethal} condition in a way that, while ensuring at least on \gls{synthetic lethal} partner is active in query deficient samples, disrupts the number of samples with functional \gls{synthetic lethal} genes compared to other genes affecting the expected sample proportions of $\chi^2$ test.

\subsection{Multivariate Normal Simulation of Synthetic Lethality} \label{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm}

The multivariate normal simulation procedure was initially performed using the \texttt{mvtnorm} R package \citep{Genz2009, mvtnorm} (as described in Section~\ref{methods:simulation_SL_expression}) without correlation structure.

Expression is sampled from multivariate normal distribution with a mean ($\mu = 0$), standard deviation ($\sigma = 1$), and no correlation between genes ($r = 0$): $$X\sim N(\bar{\mu},\Sigma)$$  Once a query gene consistent with \glspl{synthetic lethal} has been added, the simulated \glslink{gene expression}{expression} values are tested by \gls{SLIPT} exactly as described in Section~\ref{methods:SLIPT}.

   \caption[Performance of multivariate normal simulations]{\small \textbf{Performance of multivariate normal simulations.} Simulation of \glspl{synthetic lethal} was performed sampling from a multivariate normal distribution (without correlation structure). Performance of \gls{SLIPT} declines for more synthetic partners but this is mitigated by increased sample sizes (in darker colours).

%}
\label{fig:simulation_Apr15ROC}
%\end{mdframed}
\end{figure*}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_Apr15ROC:Perf}, the statistical accuracy of \gls{SLIPT} as a binary classifier is considerably high across simulations of a full human dataset of 20,000 genes. However, with the $\chi^2$ p-value as a threshold for prediction, this is largely to desirable specificity: the majority of non-SL genes are distinguished from the few underlying \gls{synthetic lethal} genes. In this regard, the \gls{SLIPT} methodology generally performs better with larger datasets with more expected negatives and thus the results of simulations of smaller numbers of genes (e.g.,  the \glslink{graph}{graph} structures analysed in Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation}) can be applied to larger datasets where they are expected to perform comparably or better with a lower false negative rate. Accordingly, key results will be supported by replication with larger numbers of non-SL genes added to the simulations. 

However, with higher numbers of \gls{synthetic lethal} genes to detect, the sensitivity (in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_Apr15ROC:Perf}) of \gls{SLIPT} as a binary classifier of \glspl{synthetic lethal} declines, although this is somewhat mitigated by higher sample sizes (shown in darker colours). Thus the minority of true \gls{synthetic lethal} partners are more difficult to distinguish when there are more of them (and a weaker \glslink{gene expression}{expression} signal from each). While a reasonable reduction of the false positive rate can be achieved for moderate numbers of underlying \gls{synthetic lethal} partners, we can not be sure how many partners are expected to be detected in analyses of \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data. However this simulation procedure is amenable to assessing the performance of \gls{SLIPT} across simulation parameters, \glslink{graph}{graph} structures and comparisons to other approaches (presented in more detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation}).

Not all of the genes detected by \gls{SLIPT} will be true \gls{synthetic lethal} genes but these will be among the strongest candidates and it performs better with fewer underlying \gls{synthetic lethal} genes to detect. This supports a focus on pathway analyses, in particular detecting pathways for further investigation. Since individually gene candidates are not necessarily gene \gls{synthetic lethal} themselves, pathway over-representation analysis will be performed to detect functional groups recurrently detected by \gls{SLIPT} as these detection of functionally related genes further support their role in \gls{synthetic lethal} relationships in addition to being biologically informative. Alternatively, pathway \glspl{metagene} will reduce the number of underlying \gls{synthetic lethal} to identify \gls{synthetic lethal} pathways. Both of these approaches will be applied in Chapter~\ref{chap:SLIPT} to identify and replicate synthetic pathways of \textit{CDH1}. Pathways are also more likely to replicate across experimental models as demonstrated by \citet{Dixon2008}.
 
The receiver operating characteristic curves (in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_Apr15ROC:ROC}) demonstrate that \gls{SLIPT} is subject to near equal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across threshold values. The lower sensitivity and higher specificity with a binary classifiation (in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_Apr15ROC:Perf}) stems from stringent testing by \gls{SLIPT} with (\gls{FDR}) p-values adjusted for multiple tests. The area under these curves is also used to compare statistical performce (in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_Apr15ROC:AUC}), with declining performance across increased underlying \gls{synthetic lethal} partners and increased performance with sample size in multivariate normal simulations.

\subsubsection{Multivariate Normal Simulation with Correlated Genes} \label{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm_cor}
%\subsubsection{Simulated Expression Heatmaps}

Correlation structures can be added to the simulation procedure (as discussed in Section~\ref{methods:simulation_SL_expression}), starting with simple correlated blocks of genes as the $\Sigma$ parameter depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL:first}. These correlated blocks represent genes with correlated \glslink{gene expression}{expression} such as that expected by coregulation or biological pathways. Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL} gives an example of 4 \gls{synthetic lethal} genes (out of 100), each with 5 correlated genes that are not themselves \gls{synthetic lethal} partners of the query gene. This serves to test whether \gls{synthetic lethal} genes are distinguishable from correlated partners. This $\Sigma$ matrix produces a similar correlation structure (Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL:second}) in the resulting \glslink{gene expression}{expression} profiles (Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL:third}) where apart from correlated blocks of genes ($r = 0.8$), the remaining genes have only slight variations due to random sampling. The structure of the dataset, particularly between \gls{synthetic lethal} genes and the query, is shown at the \gls{gene expression} (Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL:third}) and function (Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL:fifth}). These are ordered by the \gls{SLIPT} results and the \gls{synthetic lethal} genes are ranked high, with the majority of them being distinguishable from highly correlated genes.

The use of correlation structures generalises to larger datasets, such as 1000 genes shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL1K}. \Gls{synthetic lethal} genes are highly ranked by \gls{SLIPT} and still largely distinguishable from correlated genes. As previously discussed in Section~\ref{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm}, these \gls{synthetic lethal} genes are still detectable among a larger number of true negatives and the \gls{SLIPT} methodology performs better on such datasets.

These plots (Figures~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL} and~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SL1K}) also show similar correlated blocks with a non-synthetic lethal gene (true negative) and the query gene (which is not \gls{synthetic lethal} with itself). Neither of these should be \gls{synthetic lethal} (or detected to be) but they may impact upon the performance of the model, particularly the specificity as correlated negative genes may be distinguishable from true \gls{synthetic lethal} genes. The non-synthetic lethal correlated block has no impact on \gls{synthetic lethal} detection but the impact of query correlated genes will be discussed in Section~\ref{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm_query_cor} and Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation}.

%\subsection{Replication Simulation Heatmap}
These simulations (on 100 genes) were repeated to examine the variation between detection on different samples and varying the number of underlying \gls{synthetic lethal} partners, in simulated \gls{gene expression} data with correlations structure. A small nuber (10 for each) simulations are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SLreps} to demonstrate the variation between replicate simulations, with iterative sampling from the same multivariate normal distribution. These simulations show \gls{synthetic lethal} genes are not only highly ranked by \gls{SLIPT} when there are few of them but also that they are fairly consistent across replicate simulations. Whereas they become less consistent for increasing numbers of true \gls{synthetic lethal} partners to detect and thus more difficult to distinguish from other geners, particularly those correlated with them. Similarly, the $\chi^2$ values show a marked stepwise increase with clear thresholds for SL and correlated genes in simple simulations, whereas these become less evident for higher numbers of SL partners.

Whether the \gls{synthetic lethal} genes detected in simple simulations (in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May4SLreps}) are robustly detectable across greater number of simulations, in addition to further comparions, was tested with a supporting \{gls{ROC} analysis. These results (in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_Apr15ROC2}) are very similar to simulations without correlation structure, with \gls{SLIPT} as a binary classifier having a poor sensitivity with increasing numbers of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners to detect but high specificity in a total of 20,000 genes with the vast majority being true negatives. This is reflected in a similar decline in statistical performance for increasing numbers of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners and a compensating increase in performance with higher sample size. Overall, the statistical performance is very similar to simulations without correlation structure (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mvtnorm_cor_compare}).

Thus \gls{SLIPT} is robust across correlation structures and applicable to real gene expresssion data where \glslink{graph}{pathway} structures and correlations are a consideration. These correlation structures are not intended to model specific biological pathways or represent them, rather they serve to test the impact of correlation structure on the performance of \gls{SLIPT} with an extreme example of closely correlated ($r = 0.8$) gene blocks. More complex correlation structures, such as genes postively correlated with the query gene and derived from pathway \glslink{graph}{graph} structures (as described in~\ref{methods:graphsim}) will be examined below (in Section~\ref{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm_query_cor}) and in Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation} respectively.

In particular, genes correlated with true \gls{synthetic lethal} genes have little impact on the performance of \gls{SLIPT} detection: \gls{synthetic lethal} genes are as distinguishable from true negative genes as without correlated genes. \Gls{synthetic lethal} correlated genes will not interfere detect of true \gls{synthetic lethal}, although they may be ranked next below them and be biologically informative with related gene functions.

\subsubsection{Specificity with Query-Correlated Pathways}  \label{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm_query_cor}

Another consideration for correlation structures is postively correlated genes with the query that are not \gls{synthetic lethal}. As described in Section~\ref{chapt2:simulation_mvtnorm_cor}, 5 highly correlated ($r = 0.8$) with the query gene were added. These simulations perform similarly to before (in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May15ROC2}) with a higher specficity and a lower false positive rate being feasible (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_May15ROC:Perf}).

\subsubsection{Importance of Directional Testing}
It is important to notice here that the directional criteria of the \gls{SLIPT} procedure is enhancing its performance, particularly in distinguishing positively correlated true negatives. The multivariate normal simulation results, with 20,000 genes including all of the correlation structures discussed (SL, non-SL, and query correlated genes), are compared here for \gls{SLIPT} with and without ($\chi^2$) directional testing. There is a marked improvement in statistical performance with directional criteria, particularly with increased sensitivity and lower false positive rate (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mvtnorm_dir_compare}).

This is encouraging for the application of \gls{SLIPT} to empirical \glslink{gene expression}{expression} datasets as postively correlated genes are likely to occur and the directional condition robustly improves the performance of \gls{SLIPT} across simulation parameters. Without assuming the underlying number of \gls{synthetic lethal} genes, \gls{SLIPT} will perform better than the $\chi^2$ test alone at detecting them. This is further supported irrespective of significance threshold for the $\chi^2$ test by the \{gls{ROC} analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:mvtnorm_dir_compare2}. The directional \gls{SLIPT} methodology outperforms the ordinary $\chi^2$ test at detecting \gls{synthetic lethal} partners with some predictive power (above random and \{gls{AUROC} of 0.5) even up to 100 \gls{synthetic lethal} genes.

Together these simulation results support the application of the \gls{SLIPT} methodology as it has been performed throughout Chapter~\ref{chap:SLIPT} and~\ref{chap:Pathways}. However, the methodology and simulation procedure will explored in more detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation}, with the inclusion of \glslink{graph}{graph} structures and comparison to other \gls{synthetic lethal} detection approaches.

\section{Graph Structure Methods}
Graph structures have been used in several ways in this project with novel approaches to analysis and simulations. Procedures were developed for statistical and network analysis of gene states in \glslink{graph}{pathway} structures. Specifically, the relationships between \gls{siRNA} and \gls{SLIPT} genes were tested within biological pathways in Chapter~\ref{chap:Pathways}. These \glslink{graph}{graph} structures were also used in Chapter~\ref{chap:simulation} for the simulation of \glspl{synthetic lethal} to derive correlation structure between simulated \gls{gene expression} profiles in manner that resembles biological pathways.


\subsection{Upstream and Downstream Gene Detection} \label{methods:pathway_str} 
Comparison of experimental and computational candidate \gls{synthetic lethal} partner genes within \glslink{graph}{pathway} structures arose from the hypothesis that these sets of genes were related by \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure. Due to differences in how these candidates were generated, it should not be expected that they detect the identical genes within the candidate biological pathways, rather they may be related by being upstream or downstream of each other. 

Using the Reactome version 52 data \citep{Reactome} as described in Section~\ref{methods:graph_data}, genes identified by each \gls{synthetic lethal} discovery approach were mapped to the \glslink{graph}{graph} structure for the candidate pathways identified in Chapter~\ref{chap:SLIPT} (with subgraphs defined as described in Section~\ref{methods:subgraphs}). To test whether \gls{siRNA} candidate genes were upstream of \gls{SLIPT} candidate genes, \glspl{shortest path} were traced between each potential pair of these genes in a directed network. The number of genes where the \gls{siRNA} candidate was upstream were scored ``up'' and where the \gls{siRNA} candidate was downstream were scored ``down''.  This procedure enabled counting the total number of \glspl{shortest path} which supported \gls{siRNA} genes being upstream or downstream of the \gls{SLIPT} genes and measuring the difference between these to determine if there is an imbalance in a particular direction. While this difference is indicative of the number of paths between the gene candidate groups in either direction, alone it is not sufficient to statistically support structure or relationships between \gls{siRNA} and \gls{SLIPT} genes. However, it may be combined with a permutation resampling procedure (as described in Section~\ref{methods:network_permutation}) to test for directional relationships in either direction.

The original version of this procedure excluded gene detected by both approaches since they would count in both directions. Upon further consideration, the intersection genes were restored to being accounted for by the \glspl{shortest path} counts since they may count unequally to being upstream or downstream of each gene set if there are unequal numbers above or below them in the \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure.

\subsubsection{Permutation Analysis for Statistical Significance} \label{methods:network_permutation}
A permutation procedure was developed to randomly assign members of the pathway to \gls{siRNA} and/or \gls{SLIPT} groups, with the same number of each candidate partner gene set as observed in the pathway. These permuted genes are measured for \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure between the permuted gene groups as performed for the observed candidates (as performed in Section~\ref{methods:pathway_str}). A distribution of \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure relationships expected by chance is generated by permuting iteratively over these pathways. This null distribution can be compared to the observed counts of relationships (in either direction), which yields a permutation p-value as the proportion of permutations in which had value or greater or more extreme magnitude than the observed value.

The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between these gene groups that would not have occurred had the genes been selected at random. Thus we can test both the alternate hypothesis that the \gls{siRNA} genes were upstream of the \gls{SLIPT} genes or that they are downstream of them.

The permutation procedure does not assume the underlying distribution of the data under the null hypothesis and accounts for the total number of \glslink{vertex}{nodes}, \glspl{edge}, \gls{siRNA}, and \gls{SLIPT} genes in each pathway \glslink{graph}{network} structure. The intersection size of the \gls{siRNA} and \gls{SLIPT} genes was originally not accounted for under the \gls{shortest path} counts procedure that excluded them. A refined version of this procedure ensured that the number of intersecting genes was equal to the number observed to test for \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure without changing the intersection size, the subject of prior analyses.

\subsubsection{Hierarchy Based on Biological Context} \label{methods:pathway_rank}
An alternative approach to \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure was performed based on the biological context that genes at the upstream and downstream ends of a pathway perform different functions, such as a kinase signalling cascade recieving signals from external stimuli and passes these on ribosomes or the nucleus. The genes were assigned to a hierarchy to determine if genes of either candidate group (or those with stronger support for either group) performed upstream or downstream functions disproportionately.

A network-based approach was used to determine the pathway hierarchy of genes in a computationally rational way when applied to different biological pathways with a directed \glslink{graph}{graph} structure, $G$ (without loops). The diameter of the network (i.e., the length of longest possible \gls{shortest path} between the most distant genes) was used to identify a gene ($z$) at the downstream end of the pathway (at the end of a diameter spanning \gls{shortest path}), assigned a hierarchy of: $$hierarchy(z) = 1 + diameter(G)$$ Having identified the downstream end of the pathway, genes upstream (e.g., gene $i$) of this are assigned a hierarchy by the length of their \gls{shortest path} ($d$) to this gene, $z$. $$hierarchy(i) = hierarchy(z) - d_{iz}$$ The remaining unassigned genes (e.g., gene $j$) gain the hierarchy of the length of the \gls{shortest path} downstream from the nearest assigned gene if possible. $$hierarchy(j) = hierarchy(i) + d_{ij}$$ This process may be performed iteratively to fill in pathway hierarchy but it was not necessary to perform further iterations for the candidate \gls{synthetic lethal} pathways investigated (amenable to this procedure) which exhibited clear directional structure and the \gls{small world} property (with a low diameter). Thus genes in a pathway \glslink{graph}{graph} structure were assigned integer valued hierarchy upstream to downstream by this procedure: $$hierarchy \in \{1, 2, 3, ..., 1 + diameter(G)\}$$
%new paragraph?
This hierarchy of pathway directionality (e.g.,  that shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SL_Pathway_PI3K_Ranking}) can be used for comparison with measures of the number of genes of each candidate group and the support for being \gls{synthetic lethal} partners with either approach.

\subsection{Simulating Gene Expression from Graph Structures} \label{methods:graphsim}
A further refinement of the simulation procedure generated \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data with correlation structure, derived from a known \glslink{graph}{graph} structure. %rather than correlated blocks for $\Sigma$ in \texttt{mvtnorm} \citet{mvtnorm}
This enables modelling of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners within a biological pathway and the investigation of impact of \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure on \gls{synthetic lethal} prediction. A simulated pathway is first constructed as a \glslink{graph}{graph} structure, with the \texttt{igraph} R package \citet{igraph}, with the added annotation of the state of the \glspl{edge} (i.e, whether they activate or inhibit downstream pathway members). This simulation procedure was intended for biological pathway members with correlated \gls{gene expression} (higher than the background of genes in other pathways) but it may also be applicable to modelling protein levels (in a kinase regulation cascade) or substrates and products (in a metabolic pathway).% as it is to gene regulation as it has been applied here.

First, the \glslink{graph}{graph} structure is constructed for simulated data to be generated from (by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution using the \texttt{mvtnorm} R package \citep{Genz2009, mvtnorm}). Throughout this section, the simulation procedure will be demonstrated with the relatively simple constructed \glslink{graph}{graph} structure shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_graph}. This \glslink{graph}{graph} structure visualisation was specifically developed for (directed) iGraph objects in R and has been released in the \texttt{plot.igraph} package and \texttt{igraph.extensions} library (see Table~\ref{tab:computers_r_packages_dev} and Section~\ref{methods:igraph_extensions}). The \texttt{plot\_directed} function allows customisation of plot parameters for each \glslink{vertex}{node} or \glslink{edge}{edge} and mixed (directed) \glslink{edge}{edge} types for indicating activation or inhibition. These inhibition \glslink{edge}{links} (which often occur in biological pathways) are demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_graph:second}.

%}
\label{fig:simulation_activating}
%\end{mdframed}
\end{figure*}

The simulation procedure is designed to use such \glslink{graph}{graph} structures to inform development of a ``Sigma'' variance-covariance matrix ($\Sigma$) for sampling from a multivariate normal distribution (using the \texttt{mvtnorm} R package). Given a \glslink{graph}{graph} structure (or adjacency matrix), such as Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:first}, a relation matrix is calculated based on distance such that nearer \glslink{vertex}{nodes} are given higher weight than farther \glslink{vertex}{nodes}. For the purposes of this thesis a geometrically decreasing (relative) distance weighting is used, with each more distant \glslink{vertex}{node} being related by $\sfrac{1}{2}$ compared to the next nearest as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:second}. However, an arithmetically decreasing (absolute) distance weighting is also available in the \texttt{graphsim} R package release of this procedure.

A $\Sigma$ matrix is derived from this distance weighting matrix, creating a matrix (with a diagonal of $1$) where each \glslink{vertex}{node} has a variance and standard deviation of 1. Thus covariances between adjacent \glslink{vertex}{nodes} are assigned by a correlation parameter and the remaining matrix based on weighting these correlations with by the distance matrix (or the nearest ``positive definite'' matrix). For the purposes of this thesis, the correlation parameter is $0.8$ unless otherwise specified (as used for the example in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:third}). This $\Sigma$ matrix is used to sample from a multivariate normal distribution with each gene having a mean of $0$, standard deviation $1$, and covariance within the range $[0,1]$ such that they are correlations. This procedure generates a simulated (continuous normally distributed) \glslink{gene expression}{expression} profile for each \glslink{vertex}{node} (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:fourth}) with corresponding correlation structure (Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:fifth}). The simulated correlation structure closely resembles the expected correlation structure (Sigma in~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:third}) even for the relatively modest sample size ($N=100$) illustrated in~\ref{fig:simulation_activating}. Once a simulated \gls{gene expression} dataset has been generated (as in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:fourth}), then a discrete matrix of gene function can be constructed with a functional threshold quantile to simulate functional relationships of \glspl{synthetic lethal} (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SL_Model_Expression}). For the purposes of this thesis, this threshold is the 0.3 quantile (as discussed in Section~\ref{methods:SL_Model}) which generates functional discrete matrices such as those used for \gls{synthetic lethal} simulation in Section~\ref{methods:simulating_SL} (as shown Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating:sixth})

The simulation procedure (depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_activating}) is amenable to pathways containing inhibition \glslink{edge}{links} (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_inhibiting}) with several refinements. With the inhibition \glslink{edge}{links} (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_inhibiting:first}), distances are calculated in the same manner as before (Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_inhibiting:second}) with inhibitions accounted for by iteratively multiplying downstream \glslink{vertex}{nodes} by $-1$ to form blocks of negative correlations (as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:simulation_inhibiting:third} and~\ref{fig:simulation_inhibiting:fifth}). As before, a multivariate normal distribution with these negative correlations can be sampled to generate simulated data (as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:simulation_inhibiting:fourth} and~\ref{fig:simulation_inhibiting:sixth}).  

These simulated datasets are amenable to simulating \gls{synthetic lethal} partners of a query gene within a graph network. The query gene is assumed to be separate from the graph network pathway and is added to the dataset using the procedure in Section~\ref{methods:simulating_SL}. Thus we can simulate known \gls{synthetic lethal} partner genes within a \gls{synthetic lethal} partner \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure.

\section{Customised Functions and Packages Developed} \label{methods:r_packages}

[Move to Appendix?]

Various R packages have been developed throughout this thesis using \texttt{devtools} \citep{devtools} and \texttt{roxygen} \citep{roxygen} to enable reproducibility of customised analysis and visualisation. Many of these have the added benefit of the functions being documented, demonstrated in example vignettes, and released on GitHub to enable the research community to access utilise them in their own analysis. These are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:computers_r_packages_dev}, along with the corresponding urls for their GitHub repository which contains a README file with instructions for installation with the \texttt{devtools} R package \citep{devtools} and \glslink{edge}{links} to the relevant vignette(s) where available.

\subsection{Synthetic Lethal Interaction Prediction Tool}
The statistical methodology for detection of \glspl{synthetic lethal} in \gls{gene expression} data (\gls{SLIPT}) is one of the main novel procedures developed in this thesis, as described in Section~\ref{methods:SLIPT}. The \texttt{slipt} R package has been prepared for release to accompany a publication demonstrating the applications of the methodology for identifying candidate interacting genes and pathways with \textit{CDH1} in breast cancer \citep{TCGA2012}.

\gls{SLIPT} is amenable to analysis of any effectively continuous measure of gene activity (e.g., \gls{microarray}, \acrshort{RNA}-Seq, protein abundance, or pathway \glspl{metagene}). Executing \texttt{slipt} is straightforward: the \texttt{prep\_data\_for\_SL} function scores samples as ``low'', ``medium'', or ``high'' for each gene, then the \texttt{detect\_SL} function tests a given query gene against all potential partners by performing the chi-squared test and directional conditions. This function returns a table summarising the observed and expected sample numbers used for the directional criteria, the $\chi^2$ values, and corresponding p-values including adjusting for multiple comparisons. The \texttt{count\_of\_SL} and \texttt{table\_of\_SL} functions serve to facilitate summary and extraction of the positive \gls{SLIPT} hits, respectively, from the table of predictions of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners.

The \gls{SLIPT} methodology in this package release has been used in later analyses rather than the corresponding source R code, including use on remote machines and upon simulated data. In particular, the functions in the package facilitate alterations to parameters, such as the proportion of samples called as exhibiting low or high gene activity. This release support reproducibility and enables wider use of \gls{SLIPT} in future investigations into other disease genes.

\subsection{Data Visualisation}
Customisations to existing data visualisations in R have been developed to present data throughout this thesis. The \texttt{vioplotx} and \texttt{heatmap.2x} packages are enhancements of the \texttt{vioplot} package \citep{vioplot} and \texttt{heatmap.2} provided by the \texttt{gplots} package \citep{gplots}.

The \texttt{vioplotx} package provides an alternative visualisation (of continuous variables against categories) to the more familiar boxplot, showing variability of the data by the width of the plots. As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:vioplot}, the customised version enables separate plotting parameters for each violin with vector inputs for colour, shape, and size of various elements of the median point, central boxplot, borders, and fill colour for the violin. Scaling violin width to adjust violin area and splitting data by a second categorical variable is also enabled. This function is intended to be backwards compatible with the inputs of \texttt{vioplot} (applying scalar inputs across all violins) and \texttt{boxplot} (by enabling formula inputs as an S3 method). Each of these features is demonstrated with examples in respective vignettes on the package \href{https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx}{GitHub repository}.

The \texttt{heatmap.2x} provides extensions for annotation colour bars for both the rows and columns (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap.2x}). Multiple bars are enabled on both axes with matrix inputs (rather than single vector for \texttt{heatmap.2}) which facilitates additional plotting of gene and sample characteristics for comparison with correlation matrices, \glslink{gene expression}{expression} profiles, or pathway \glspl{metagene}. Annotation bar inputs correspond to their orientation on the plot, each colour bar is provided as a column for the row annotation on the left of the heatmap and as a row for the column annotation on top of the heatmap. Row and column annotation bars are labelled with the column or row names respectively. Additional parameters enable resizing of these annotation bar labels and control of reordering columns for if samples are ordered in advance (e.g., ranked by a \gls{metagene} or split into groups clustered separately).  These features were used through this thesis and are provided in a package \href{https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/heatmap.2x}{GitHub repository}.

\subsection{Extensions to the iGraph Package} \label{methods:igraph_extensions}
The following features were developed during this thesis using ``iGraph'' data objects, building upon the \texttt{igraph} package \citep{igraph}. These have been released as separate packages for each respective procedure and can be installed together as a collection of extensions to the \texttt{igraph} package.

\subsubsection{Sampling Simulated Data from Graph Structures}
The \texttt{graphsim} package implements the procedure for simulating \gls{gene expression} from \glslink{graph}{graph} structures (as described in Section~\ref{methods:graphsim}). By default, this derives a matrix with a geometrically decreasing weighting by distance (by \glspl{shortest path}) between each pair of \glslink{vertex}{nodes} with. An absolute decreasing weighting is also available with the option of to derive correlation structures from adjacency matrices or the number of \glslink{edge}{links} common partners (i.e., size of the shared ``neighbourhood'' \citep{Hell1976}) between each pair of \glslink{vertex}{nodes}. Functions to compute these are called directly by passing parameters to them when running the \texttt{generate\_expression} or \texttt{make\_sigma\_mat} commands. This package enables simulating \glslink{gene expression}{expression} data directly from a \glslink{graph}{graph} structure (with the intermediate steps automated) or generating $\Sigma$ parameters for \texttt{mvtnorm} from \glslink{graph}{graph} structures or matrices derived from them. These functions support assigning activating or inhibiting to each \glslink{edge}{edge} (with a \texttt{state} parameter).

\subsubsection{Plotting Directed Graph Structures}
The \texttt{plot.igraph} package provides the \texttt{plot\_directed} function specifically developed for directed \glslink{graph}{graph} structures and to plot activating or inhibiting for each \glslink{edge}{edge} (as described in Section~\ref{methods:graphsim}). As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_graph2}, this function supports separate plotting parameters for each \glslink{vertex}{node}, \glslink{vertex}{node} label, and \glslink{edge}{edge}. This includes colours of \glslink{vertex}{node} fill, border, label text, and \glspl{edge} and size of \glslink{vertex}{nodes}, \glslink{edge}{edge} widths, arrowhead lengths, and font size of labels. The  \texttt{state} parameter for assigning activating or inhibiting to each \glslink{edge}{edge} determines whether \glspl{edge} are dipected with 30\textdegree\ or 90\textdegree\ arrowheads. Colours are assigned separately and so they may be customised. Vectorised parameters are applied across each \glslink{vertex}{node} or \glslink{edge}{edge}, whereas scalar parameters apply the same plotting parameters across them. The default layout function is \texttt{layout.fruchterman.reingold} but any layout function supported by \texttt{plot} function in \texttt{igraph} \citep{igraph} is compatible such as \texttt{layout.kamada.kawai} used to implement the Kamada--Kawai algorithm \citep{Kamada1989} for graph plots throughout this thesis.

\subsubsection{Computing Information Centrality} 
The \glspl{shortest path} of a network are computed by the \texttt{igraph} package \citet{igraph} which can be extended to calculate the network efficiency but is not provided by the package itself (ss described in Section~\ref{methods:network_metrics}). The ``\gls{information centrality}'' of a \glslink{vertex}{vertex} is computed as the relative change in the network efficiency when the \glslink{vertex}{vertex} is removed. \Gls{information centrality} is calculated iteratively for each \glslink{vertex}{node} and the sum of \gls{information centrality} for each \glslink{vertex}{vertex} is the \gls{information centrality} for the network. These metrics are provided by the \texttt{info.centrality} package.

\subsubsection{Testing Pathway Structure with Permutation Testing}
A network-based procedure developed was used for comparison of \gls{siRNA} and \gls{SLIPT} candidate genes in a \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure. Such \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure relationships were tested by computing the number of \glspl{shortest path} between two different groups of \glslink{vertex}{nodes} in either direction within a graph . This pathway relationship metric was implemented in the \texttt{pathway.structure.permutation} package with permutation testing (as described in sections~\ref{methods:pathway_str} and~\ref{methods:network_permutation}). 

\subsubsection{Metapackage to Install iGraph Functions}
These features may be installed together with \texttt{igraph.extensions} which can be accessed from a \href{https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/igraph.extensions}{GitHub repository}. This meta-package installs \texttt{igraph} \citep{igraph} and the packages described in Section~\ref{methods:igraph_extensions} including their dependencies for matrix operations and statistical procedures: \texttt{Matrix}, \texttt{matrixcalc}, and \texttt{mvtnorm} \citep{Matrix, matrixcalc, Genz2009, mvtnorm}.

\section{Developing a Synthetic Lethal detection methodology}

\subsection{Testing Multivariate Normal Simulation of \Glspl{synthetic lethal}}

We have developed a model of \glspl{synthetic lethal} in \gls{gene expression} data based on sampling a Multivariate Normal distribution.  This enables simulation of statistically testing for \gls{synthetic lethal} genes where the true and false positives are known, discovery of the expected test statistic distributions for different conditions, educated thresholds for public data analysis, and building a complex model with known correlation structure between genes.  Sampling a small number of genes from this model shows, in Figure 4, that \glspl{synthetic lethal} is detectable with in a simple model.

Figure 4.  Chi-Square (upper) and p-values (lower) distributions show that \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (red) are distinguishable from correlated (blue) and other genes (black) in an example simulation of sampling 1000 samples and 100 genes, from a multivariate normal distribution with 1 (left), 2 (centre), and 3 (right) \gls{synthetic lethal} partners respectively, showing that \gls{synthetic lethal} genes become more difficult to detect if there are more true partners.

Figure 5.  Chi-Square (upper), \gls{FDR} adjusted p-values (centre), and Holm adjusted p-values (lower) show that show that \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (red) are distinguishable from correlated (blue) and other genes (black) are distinguishable replicated across 1000 replicate simulated sampling of 1000 samples and 100 genes, from a multivariate normal distribution with 1 (left), 2 (centre), and 3 (right) \gls{synthetic lethal} partners respectively, showing \gls{synthetic lethal} genes become more difficult to detect in with more true partners but adjusting p-values may be too stringent an approach to this.

Having shown that the Chi-Square test is capable of detecting \glspl{synthetic lethal}, Figure 5 shows that detecting \glspl{synthetic lethal} in a simple case is largely robust and reproducible across many replicates with \gls{synthetic lethal} and correlated genes clearly having higher test statistic scores and lower adjusted p-values than the null distribution of non-synthetic lethal genes when there are only 1 or 2 \gls{synthetic lethal} partners.  While it is promising that correlated genes and \gls{synthetic lethal} partners could be distinguished from other genes in a simple case, there is also indication that true \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (candidates as robust drug targets) and their correlated genes (or pathways) could be distinguished by test statistic.

However, such clear evidence of \glspl{synthetic lethal} by co-loss under-representation is rarely detected in public data analyses, indicating cryptic additional \gls{synthetic lethal} genes compensating for the loss of both the query and putative synthetic partner.  Therefore higher-order \gls{synthetic lethal} is potentially very common, difficult to detect, and confounding attempts to identify \gls{synthetic lethal} pairs from \gls{gene expression} data.  In Figure 5, more than 3 \gls{synthetic lethal} partners will be difficult to identify directly with a Chi-Square test.  Although deeper understanding of the system could still enable use of the procedure to prioritise small numbers of candidate genes, estimate the number of underlying true synthetic partners, and identify the biological pathways interacting with a gene to focus complementary experimental approaches.

With higher number of true \gls{synthetic lethal} genes there is no clear threshold for Chi-Square values (or associated p-values) to detect \glspl{synthetic lethal} and choosing any threshold is a trade-off between sensitivity (ensuring all true positives are detected) and specificity (reducing the number of false positives detected).  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, summarise this trade-off to show the statistical performance of a test where the true \gls{synthetic lethal} genes are known in the simulated data.  Performance of a statistical test is measured as the area under the \{gls{ROC} (AUROC) curves, as shown in Figures 8 and 9, to compare performance across simulations for different parameters such as type of model, correlation structure, the total number of genes, sample size and number of true \gls{synthetic lethal} genes.  A random predictor has an \{gls{AUROC} of 0.5, whereas an ideal predictor has an \{gls{AUROC} of 1.0, so intermediate values are expected.

\subsection{Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves}

Figure 6.   \{gls{ROC} curves showing statistical performance (by area under the curve) of a \gls{synthetic lethal} simulation based on sampling a Binomial distribution, with 20,000 genes, averaged over 1000 replicates, sample size (1000, 2000, 5000, or 10,000) and number of \gls{synthetic lethal} genes (up to 100) varies by panel and colour showing better performance with fewer \gls{synthetic lethal} genes or higher sample size.    

Figure 7.   \{gls{ROC} curves of a \gls{synthetic lethal} simulation based on sampling a Multivariate Normal distribution, with 20,000 genes, averaged over 1000 replicates, sample size and number of \gls{synthetic lethal} genes varies by panel and colour showing better performance than a Binomial model and similar performance with correlation structure (upper panes).

Figure 8.  Comparison of Binomial (red) and Multivariate Normal models with (blue) and without (green) correlation structure by simulation with 1000 samples, 20,000 genes, sample size varied by pane, and number of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners on the x axis where performance on the y axis is measured as the \{gls{AUROC} showing better performance in the Multivariate Normal model than the Binomial model and similar performance in the Multivariate Normal model with correlation structure added for all simulation parameters.  There was better performance with fewer \gls{synthetic lethal} partners or higher sample size with both Multivariate Normal models.   

Figure 6 shows performance of an earlier model based on the Binomial distribution for gene function calls, based on similar a Normally distributed model of \gls{gene expression} which called gene function from an arbitrary \glslink{gene expression}{expression} cut-off.  This model is shown for comparison with Multivariate model we have chosen to develop since the Multivariate model, as shown in Figure 7, has better performance, allows the inclusion of correlation structure expected in \gls{gene expression} data for biological pathways, and could have variable gene function cut-offs.  

Figures 7 and 8, show that the Multivariate model which corrects this effect by specifying \gls{synthetic lethal} genes differently performs better in simulations, even with correlation structure expected to disrupt the \gls{synthetic lethal} detection.  There is indication in Figure 8 that correlation structure even improves the performance of simulations.  Although replicated across parameters, the difference in performance of simulations with correlated genes (with each \gls{synthetic lethal} partner) is marginal and the number of correlated genes is still vastly outnumbered by the total number of genes (20,000 modelling a complete mammalian \glspl{genome}).  Simulations with fewer total genes may show the impact of correlated genes more clearly, which is biologically plausible since some co-regulated pathways do involve a substantial proportion of the \glspl{genome}.

As indicated, the models behave as expected when performing better when simulated with higher sample size and fewer true \gls{synthetic lethal} genes.  As summarised in Figure 9, this behaviour occurs in simulation with all of the models discussed above.  The number of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners impacts performance with a sigmoidal decay where­­ higher sample size (albeit approaching the limit of feasible \gls{genomic}-scale projects) markedly delay decay of \{gls{AUROC} towards random 0.5.  Therefore a large sample size is crucial for \gls{bioinformatics} \gls{synthetic lethal} discovery.  Only a small number of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners will be detectable with a gene-centric approach motivating pathway-centric approaches and accounting for \glslink{graph}{pathway} structure, which has shown be more reproducible between model organism experiments (Dixon et al. 2009).  However, whether potential false positives are more likely to be correlated genes or occur due to the sheer number of true negatives (and multiple tests) is unclear.  The impact of correlation structure on the simulated data is explored in detail below in Figures 10-12 and the results of these simulations repeated is shown in Figure 13.    Figure 9.  Summary of effect of sample size and number of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners on performance of simulations for prediction of \glspl{synthetic lethal} by \{gls{AUROC} on continuous scale (left) and as a barplot (right) showing that sample size (by colour) and number of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (x axis) affects performance as expected in which was replicated across all 3 models discussed above.

\subsection{Simulated Expression Heatmaps}

In Figures 10-12 below, simulations are summarised with expected (Sigma) and generated (Correlation) structure of \gls{gene expression} patterns in the top figures.  The following line shows how the \glslink{gene expression}{expression} and gene function calls have been distributed with correlation structure and ordering samples (columns) to ensure a \gls{synthetic lethal} partner or query gene is active in each sample.

Figure 10.  Simulation for 1 SL partner (100 genes, 1000 samples)

Figure 11.  Simulation for 2 SL partners (100 genes, 1000 samples)

Figure 12.  Simulation for 3 SL partners (100 genes, 1000 samples)

As shown in the Figures 10-12, the correlation structure of the simulated \gls{gene expression} data (upper right) largely reflects the expected sigma matrix (upper left) used to specify the variation in the Multivariate Normal distribution with some variation due to low sampling error.  The Sigma and correlation matrices show blocks of correlated genes with each \gls{synthetic lethal} partner where there are 1, 2, or 3 \gls{synthetic lethal} partners in Figures 10, 11, and 12 respectively.  In the \gls{gene expression} heatmap (lower right) and associated discrete gene function calls based on a threshold of the 30\% quantile (lower left), the sample (column) ordering shows how samples were ordered so at least one \gls{synthetic lethal} gene is active in all query deficient samples.  The row (gene) ordering is based on a Chi-Square test statistic value and odds-ratio sign (with negative genes at the top), apart from Query gene at the top (with positive odds-ratio).  The Chi-Square values are shown on the outer colour bar on a log scale and the inner colour bar annotates the known gene class in the simulation: query (blue), \gls{synthetic lethal} (red), correlated (orange), and other (green).

With 1 \gls{synthetic lethal} partner, in Figure 10, the relationship between \gls{synthetic lethal} (and correlated genes with the Query gene is clear and detectable with Chi-Square test (as shown with the colour bars) as expected.  The relationship is clearer in the true \gls{synthetic lethal} partner showing that it should be distinguishable from confounding correlated genes.  With multiple \gls{synthetic lethal} genes, as shown in Figures 11 and 12, the true \gls{synthetic lethal} partner is less related to the \glslink{gene expression}{expression} profile of the Query gene and the co-loss under-representation is more difficult to detect since the number of co-occuring loss of \gls{synthetic lethal} genes expected (even in Query functional samples is low).  In these examples, the Chi-Square test still correctly identifies \gls{synthetic lethal} genes with the highest test statistic, although with a less well defined cut-off and it may not be reproducible (as discussed above).  This is consistent with more \gls{synthetic lethal} partners being able to recover function and ensure cell survival which is plausible given the evolutionary \glslink{genetic robustness}{robustness} of molecular networks, difficulty detecting individual gene pairs in \gls{gene expression} data, and rates of recurrence or drug resistance in cancer patients.  Therefore we have to consider cryptic \gls{synthetic lethal} genes compensating for Query and candidate \gls{synthetic lethal} partners due to higher-order \glslink{functional redundancy}{genetic redundancy}, cancer \gls{genomic} evolution and cellular heterogeneity.

\subsection{Replication Simulation Heatmap}

The declining performance in \{gls{ROC} curves with more \gls{synthetic lethal} genes shows that the ability to robustly distinguish \gls{synthetic lethal} genes from other genes (including their correlated genes) declines as the \gls{synthetic lethal} genes do not consistently have a higher Chi-Square test statistic across replicate sampling simulations.  Although it is noted that increased sample size can compensate for this decline, increasing the number of expected co-loss events and sensitivity of the procedure.  The effect of total gene number, impact of correlation structure, and reproducibility of Chi-Square tests across replicate sampling simulations is explored below.

Figure 13 is composed of columns of side colour bars ordered by Chi-Square and odds-ratio sign (with Query in the corrected position at the bottom) as shown in Figures 10-12 with separate columns for repeated sampling with different parameters.  Figure 13 is an example of this visualisation of simulations for a small number of genes (100) and replicates (10 each for 1 to 10 \gls{synthetic lethal} partners).  Even in this small simulation, we see many of the processes discussed above summarised: the effect of number of \gls{synthetic lethal} genes on Chi-Square tests, power to detect \gls{synthetic lethal} and other correlated genes, decaying reproducibility and variation across replicates, lack of a clear threshold, and importance of directional conditions (e.g., odds-ratio sign) to distinguish \gls{synthetic lethal} and co-expressed genes.  This visualisation is an effective way to capture the simulation process and compare conditions which will be valuable for more complex correlation structure and comparison to public data Chi-Square distributions.
    
Figure 13.  Comparison of simulation across various parameters for sampling a Multivariate Normal model for 100 genes and 1000 samples with correlation structure with 10 replicates (columns) for each number of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (1 to 10 in the top colour bar) with genes sorted by chi-squared value (and odds-ratio negative at the top) this shows preferential sorting of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners (red) and correlated (orange) genes near the top (on the left) for lower numbers of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners which becomes less clear or consistent across replicates for higher numbers of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners, reflected in less variation in chi-square values (shown in log-scale on the right) and lack of a clear prediction threshold, however positive odds-ratio genes show no preference except for the query gene associated itself as expected.

This framework may also be useful to compare different analyses of public data and infer the true number of \gls{synthetic lethal} partners from the distribution of test statistic scores.  With an effective visualisation, we can further explore more complex correlation structures (as shown in the supplementary Figures S1 and S2).  This will be important to develop simulated data as similar to empirical data as possible, to test whether \gls{synthetic lethal} and correlated genes are robustly detectable, and discover effective drug targets (which are repeatable across a cohort, tissues or species).  The impact of high-order \glspl{synthetic lethal}, genetic background and variation between replicates indicates that more care has to be taken interpreting experimental model systems and \glspl{genomic} analysis will be valuable to ensure candidate drug targets are suitable for clinical application.  We show below that this visualisation scales up and shows similar effects for number of \gls{synthetic lethal} genes in more replicates (Figure 14), more total genes (Figure 15), and both (Figure 16).
