A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {The identification of genes predisposing to familial cancer is an essential step towards understanding the molecular events underlying tumorigenesis and is critical for the clinical management of affected families. Despite a declining incidence, gastric cancer remains a major cause of cancer death worldwide, and about 10% of cases show familial clustering. The relative contributions of inherited susceptibility and environmental effects to familial gastric cancer are poorly understood because little is known of the genetic events that predispose to gastric cancer. Here we describe the identification of the gene responsible for early-onset, histologically poorly differentiated, high grade, diffuse gastric cancer in a large kindred from New Zealand (Aotearoa). Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage to markers flanking the gene for the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin. Sequencing of the E-cadherin gene revealed a G --> T nucleotide substitution in the donor splice consensus sequence of exon 7, leading to a truncated gene product. Diminished E-cadherin expression is associated with aggressive, poorly differentiated carcinomas. Underexpression of E-cadherin is a prognostic marker of poor clinical outcome in many tumour types, and restored expression of E-cadherin in tumour models can suppress the invasiveness of epithelial tumour cells. The role of E-cadherin in gastric cancer susceptibility was confirmed by identifying inactivating mutations in other gastric cancer families. In one family, a frameshift mutation was identified in exon 15, and in a second family a premature stop codon interrupted exon 13. These results describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a molecular basis for familial gastric cancer, and confirm the important role of E-cadherin mutations in cancer.},

  abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or batch effects are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

So, targeting a gene that is synthetic lethal to a cancer-relevant mutation should kill only cancer cells and spare normal cells. Synthetic lethality therefore provides a conceptual framework for the development of cancer-specific cytotoxic agents. This paradigm has not been exploited in the past because there were no robust methods for systematically identifying synthetic lethal genes. This is changing as a result of the increased availability of chemical and genetic tools for perturbing gene function in somatic cells.},

However, we understand little about how genes interact because very few possible genetic interactions have been explored experimentally. We have used RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans to systematically test approximately 65,000 pairs of genes for their ability to interact genetically. We identify approximately 350 genetic interactions between genes functioning in signaling pathways that are mutated in human diseases, including components of the EGF/Ras, Notch and Wnt pathways. Most notably, we identify a class of highly connected 'hub' genes: inactivation of these genes can enhance the phenotypic consequences of mutation of many different genes. These hub genes all encode chromatin regulators, and their activity as genetic hubs seems to be conserved across animals. We propose that these genes function as general buffers of genetic variation and that these hub genes may act as modifier genes in multiple, mechanistically unrelated genetic diseases in humans.},

Wediscuss the biological rationale for BRCA-PARP synthetic lethality, how the synthetic lethal approach is being assessed in the clinic, and how mechanisms of resistance are starting to be dissected. Applying the synthetic lethal concept to target non-BRCA-mutant cancers also has clear potential, and we discuss how some of the principles learned in developing PARP inhibitors might also drive the development of additional genetic approaches.

  abstract = {Synthetic Lethal (SL) genetic interactions play a key role in various types of biological research, ranging from understanding genotype-phenotype relationships to identifying drug-targets against cancer. Despite recent advances in empirical measuring SL interactions in human cells, the human genetic interaction map is far from complete. Here, we present a novel approach to predict this map by exploiting patterns in cancer genome evolution. First, we show that empirically determined SL interactions are reflected in various gene presence, absence, and duplication patterns in hundreds of cancer genomes. The most evident pattern that we discovered is that when one member of an SL interaction gene pair is lost, the other gene tends not to be lost, i.e. the absence of co-loss. This observation is in line with expectation, because the loss of an SL interacting pair will be lethal to the cancer cell. SL interactions are also reflected in gene expression profiles, such as an under representation of cases where the genes in an SL pair are both under expressed, and an over representation of cases where one gene of an SL pair is under expressed, while the other one is over expressed. We integrated the various previously unknown cancer genome patterns and the gene expression patterns into a computational model to identify SL pairs. This simple, genome-wide model achieves a high prediction power (AUC = 0.75) for known genetic interactions. It allows us to present for the first time a comprehensive genome-wide list of SL interactions with a high estimated prediction precision, covering up to 591,000 gene pairs. This unique list can potentially be used in various application areas ranging from biotechnology to medical genetics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vemurafenib is an oral, small-molecule kinase inhibitor that selectively targets activated BRAF V600E and has been approved for the treatment of advanced BRAF mutation-positive melanoma. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib and in addition outlines proposed mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance. METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE and ScienceVerse Scopus was performed using the key words malignant melanoma, BRAF, vemurafenib, and PLX4032. Scientific abstracts, US Food and Drug Administration Web site data (www.accessdata.fda.gov), the manufacturer-submitted approval data from ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the references from applicable publications were also consulted. RESULTS: Clinical studies have reported that vemurafenib is efficacious and acceptably well-tolerated. In a Phase I study (BRIM-1), a 960-mg BID dose achieved an objective response rate of 81% among 32 patients with melanoma who carried a BRAF V600E mutation. Of the 26 responders, 2 achieved a complete response and 24 a partial response. In BRIM-2, 132 BRAF V600E-positive patients achieved an overall response rate of 53% (95% CI, 44%-62%); 6% achieved a complete response and 47%, a partial response. Response was noted at 6 weeks and lasted a median of 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6-8.6). Median survival was 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.6-18.3); 77% of patients survived to 6 months (95% CI, 70-85) and 58% to 12 months (95% CI, 11.6-18.3), and an estimated 43% were expected to survive to 18 months (95% CI, 33-53). The Phase III study (BRIM-3) compared vemurafenib to dacarbazine. The hazard ratio (HR) for death with vemurafenib was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.26-0.55; P < 0.001). At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% CI, 78-89) versus 64% (95% CI, 56-73) in the vemurafenib and dacarbazine treatment arms, respectively. The HR for tumor progression in the vemurafenib cohort was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.20-0.33; P < 0.001), and the estimated median progression-free survival was 5.3 months with vemurafenib versus 1.6 months with dacarbazine. Finally, the difference in response rates was significant (48% vs 5%, respectively; P < 0.001). The most common adverse events reported have been arthralgia, rash, photosensitivity, fatigue, pruritus, alopecia, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, diarrhea, and mild to moderate nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib is effective for advanced melanomas expressing the BRAF V600E mutations. Resistance to BRAF inhibition can be problematic, but new evidence suggests that combination therapy may attenuate the issue. Targeting the cellular activity of melanoma cells is reported to be efficacious and is expected to delay progression and prolong survival.},

  abstract = {Secretory factors that drive cancer progression are attractive immunotherapeutic targets. We used a whole-genome data-mining approach on multiple cohorts of breast tumours annotated for clinical outcomes to discover such factors. We identified Serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1) to be associated with poor survival in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cases. Immunohistochemistry showed that SPINK1 was absent in normal breast, present in early and advanced tumours, and its expression correlated with poor survival in ER+ tumours. In ER- cases, the prognostic effect did not reach statistical significance. Forced expression and/or exposure to recombinant SPINK1 induced invasiveness without affecting cell proliferation. However, down-regulation of SPINK1 resulted in cell death. Further, SPINK1 overexpressing cells were resistant to drug-induced apoptosis due to reduced caspase-3 levels and high expression of Bcl2 and phospho-Bcl2 proteins. Intriguingly, these anti-apoptotic effects of SPINK1 were abrogated by mutations of its protease inhibition domain. Thus, SPINK1 affects multiple aggressive properties in breast cancer: survival, invasiveness and chemoresistance. Because SPINK1 effects are abrogated by neutralizing antibodies, we suggest that SPINK1 is a viable potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.},

  journal = {Mol Cancer Ther},
  abstract = {The CDH1 gene, which encodes the cell-to-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, is frequently mutated in lobular breast cancer (LBC) and diffuse gastric cancer (DGC). However, because E-cadherin is a tumor suppressor protein and lost from the cancer cell, it is not a conventional drug target. To overcome this, we have taken a synthetic lethal approach to determine whether the loss of E-cadherin creates druggable vulnerabilities. We first conducted a genome wide siRNA screen of isogenic MCF10A cells with and without CDH1 expression. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling proteins were highly enriched amongst the synthetic lethal candidates. Diverse families of cytoskeletal proteins were also frequently represented. These broad classes of E-cadherin synthetic lethal hits were validated using both lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown and specific antagonists including the JAK inhibitor LY2784544, Pertussis toxin and the aurora kinase inhibitors Alisertib and Danusertib. Next, we conducted a 4,057 known drug screen and time course studies on the CDH1 isogenic MCF10A cell lines and identified additional drug classes with linkages to GPCR signalling and cytoskeletal function that showed evidence of E-cadherin synthetic lethality. These included multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors including Vorinostat and Entinostat, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors Crizotinib and Saracatinib. Together, these results demonstrate that E-cadherin loss creates druggable vulnerabilities that have the potential to improve the management of both sporadic and familial LBC and DGC.},

  abstract = {Two genes are called synthetic lethal (SL) if their simultaneous mutations lead to cell death, but each individual mutation does not. Targeting SL partners of mutated cancer genes can kill cancer cells specifically, but leave normal cells intact. We present an integrated approach to uncovering SL pairs in colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening verified SL pairs using microarray gene expression data of cancerous and normal tissues, we first identified potential functionally relevant (simultaneously differentially expressed) gene pairs. From the top-ranked pairs, ~20 genes were chosen for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in 171 CRC patients. To find novel SL pairs, all 169 combined pairs from the individual IHC were synergistically correlated to five clinicopathological features, e.g. overall survival. Of the 11 predicted SL pairs, MSH2-POLB and CSNK1E-MYC were consistent with literature, and we validated the top two pairs, CSNK1E-TP53 and CTNNB1-TP53 using RNAi knockdown and small molecule inhibitors of CSNK1E in isogenic HCT-116 and RKO cells. Furthermore, synthetic lethality of CSNK1E and TP53 was verified in mouse model. Importantly, multivariate analysis revealed that CSNK1E-P53, CTNNB1-P53, MSH2-RB1, and BRCA1-WNT5A were independent prognosis markers from stage, with CSNK1E-P53 applicable to early-stage and the remaining three throughout all stages. Our findings suggest that CSNK1E is a promising target for TP53-mutant CRC patients which constitute ~40% to 50% of patients, while to date safety regarding inhibition of TP53 is controversial. Thus the integrated approach is useful in finding novel SL pairs for cancer therapeutics, and it is readily accessible and applicable to other cancers.},

A maximum tolerated dose and initial signal of efficacy in BRCA-deficient ovarian cancers have been reported. We therefore assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib alone in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and advanced breast cancer. METHODS: Women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent, advanced breast cancer were assigned to two sequential cohorts in a phase 2 study undertaken in 16 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The first cohort (n=27) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg twice daily), and the second (n=27) was given a lower dose (100 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494234. FINDINGS: Patients had been given a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5 in cohort 1, and 2-4 in cohort 2). ORR was 11 (41%) of 27 patients (95% CI 25-59) in the cohort assigned to 400 mg twice daily, and six (22%) of 27 (11-41) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. Toxicities were mainly at low grades. The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 400 mg twice daily were fatigue (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), vomiting (grade 1 or 2, three [11%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or 2, one [4%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]). The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 100 mg twice daily were nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; none grade 3 or 4) and fatigue (grade 1 or 2, seven [26%]; grade 3 or 4, one [4%]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this study provide positive proof of concept for PARP inhibition in BRCA-deficient breast cancers and shows a favourable therapeutic index for a novel targeted treatment strategy in patients with tumours that have genetic loss of function of BRCA1-associated or BRCA2-associated DNA repair. Toxicity in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was similar to that reported previously in those without such mutations. FUNDING: AstraZeneca.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Identification of genes that are synthetic lethal to p53 is an important strategy for anticancer therapy as p53 mutations have been reported to occur in more than half of all human cancer cases. Although genome-wide RNAi screening is an effective approach to finding synthetic lethal genes, it is costly and labor-intensive.METHODS:To illustrate this approach, we identified potentially druggable genes synthetically lethal for p53 using three microarray datasets for gene expression profiles of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines, one next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and one gene expression data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. We selected the genes which encoded kinases and had significantly higher expression in the tumors with functional p53 mutations (somatic mutations) than in the tumors without functional p53 mutations as the candidates of druggable synthetic lethal genes for p53. We identified important regulatory networks and functional categories pertinent to these genes, and performed an extensive survey of literature to find experimental evidence that support the synthetic lethality relationships between the genes identified and p53. We also examined the drug sensitivity difference between NCI-60 cell lines with functional p53 mutations and NCI-60 cell lines without functional p53 mutations for the compounds that target the kinases encoded by the genes identified.RESULTS:Our results indicated that some of the candidate genes we identified had been experimentally verified to be synthetic lethal for p53 and promising targets for anticancer therapy while some other genes were putative targets for development of cancer therapeutic agents.CONCLUSIONS:Our study indicated that pre-screening of potential synthetic lethal genes using gene expression profiles is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of synthetic lethal RNAi screening.},

We clarify the relationships existing between these tests, in particular the equivalence between the hypergeometric test and Fisher's exact test.

Hypermethylation in the CDH1 promoter region is a frequent phenomenon in poorly differentiated, diffuse gastric carcinomas and it was identified as the main mechanism for the inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele in HDGC cases. Specific criteria are used to identify patients with suspected HDGC and who should be investigated for CDH1 germline mutations. Accurate screening is mandatory for unaffected carriers of CDH1 mutations and selected high-risk individuals could be considered for prophylactic gastrectomy. Also, germline CDH1 mutations may predispose to lobular breast carcinoma and prostate cancer.Germline CDH1 mutations are not always detectable in patients who meet the HDGC criteria and the aetiological role of this gene is still under investigation. Families without recognised inactivating CDH1 mutations may have undisclosed CDH1 mutations or mutations in its regulatory sequences or germline mutations in unidentified genes that also contribute to the disease. In recent years, several germline missense CDH1 mutations have been identified, some of which showed a marked negative influence on E-cadherin function in experimental models. CDH1 promoter hypermethylation seems a key event in the carcinogenetic process of poorly differentiated, diffuse gastric cancer and it deserves further investigation as a new target for anticancer therapies with demethylating agents.},

  abstract = {The calcium-dependent homophilic cell adhesion molecule and candidate suppressor gene, E (epithelial)-cadherin, plays a major role in the organization and integrity of most epithelial tissues. Diffusely growing gastric carcinomas show markedly reduced homophilic cell-to-cell interactions. We speculated that mutations in the E-cadherin gene may be responsible for the scattered phenotype of this type of carcinoma. For that reason we have examined E-cadherin in 26 diffuse type, 20 intestinal type and 7 mixed gastric carcinomas (Laurén's classification) at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels.Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of amplified E-cadherin complementary DNA fragments revealed inframe skipping of either exon 8 or exon 9 in 10 patients with diffuse tumors and an exon 9 deletion in one patient with a mixed carcinoma; both exons encode putative calcium binding domains. These alterations were not seen in nontumorous gastric tissues. Splice site mutations responsible for the exon deletions were identified in six of these patients, eliminating the possibility of alternative splicing mechanisms. Five of these splice site alterations were confirmed as somatic mutations. Non-splice site mutations were observed in three diffuse type tumors, namely a 69-base pair deletion of exon 10 and two point mutations, one of which destroys a putative calcium binding region. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed E-cadherin immunoreactivity in tumors and lymph node metastases of patients expressing abnormal mRNA. The allelic status of the E-cadherin gene was analyzed in one patient, revealing loss of heterozygosity with retention of a mutated E-cadherin allele. Overall, E-cadherin mutations were identified in 50% (13 of 26) of the diffuse type and in 14% (1 of 7) of the mixed carcinomas. In contrast, two silent E-cadherin mutations (not changing the amino acid sequence) were detected in two tumors of the intestinal type.Our study provides strong in vivo evidence that E-cadherin gene mutations may contribute to the development of diffusely growing gastric carcinomas and support a tumor/metastasis suppressor gene hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Germline CDH1 point or small frameshift mutations can be identified in 30–50% of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) families. We hypothesized that CDH1 genomic rearrangements would be found in HDGC and identified 160 families with either two gastric cancers in first-degree relatives and with at least one diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) diagnosed before age 50, or three or more DGC in close relatives diagnosed at any age. Sixty-seven carried germline CDH1 point or small frameshift mutations. We screened germline DNA from the 93 mutation negative probands for large genomic rearrangements by Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification. Potential deletions were validated by RT–PCR and breakpoints cloned using a combination of oligo-CGH-arrays and long-range-PCR. In-silico analysis of the CDH1 locus was used to determine a potential mechanism for these rearrangements. Six of 93 (6.5%) previously described mutation negative HDGC probands, from low GC incidence populations (UK and North America), carried genomic deletions (UK and North America). Two families carried an identical deletion spanning 193 593 bp, encompassing the full CDH3 sequence and CDH1 exons 1 and 2. Other deletions affecting exons 1, 2, 15 and/or 16 were identified. The statistically significant over-representation of Alus around breakpoints indicates it as a likely mechanism for these deletions. When all mutations and deletions are considered, the overall frequency of CDH1 alterations in HDGC is ∼46% (73/160). CDH1 large deletions occur in 4% of HDGC families by mechanisms involving mainly non-allelic homologous recombination in Alu repeat sequences. As the finding of pathogenic CDH1 mutations is useful for management of HDGC families, screening for deletions should be offered to at-risk families.},

  abstract = {Loss of E-cadherin expression or function in tumors leads to a more invasive phenotype. In this study, we investigated whether the invasion suppressor activity of E-cadherin is mediated directly by tighter physical cell adhesion, indirectly by sequestering beta-catenin and thus antagonizing beta-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) signaling, or by other signaling pathways. To distinguish mechanisms, we expressed wild-type E-cadherin and various E-cadherin mutants in invasive E-cadherin-negative human breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (TSU-Pr1) epithelial carcinoma cell lines using a tetracycline-inducible system. Our data confirm that E-cadherin inhibits human mammary and prostate tumor cell invasion. We find that adhesion is neither necessary nor sufficient for suppressing cancer invasion. Rather, the invasion suppressor signal is mediated through the beta-catenin-binding domain of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail but not through the p120ctn-binding domain. beta-catenin depletion also results in invasion suppression. However, alteration in the beta-catenin/TCF transcriptional regulation of target genes is not required for the invasion suppressor activity of E-cadherin, suggesting the involvement of other beta-catenin-binding proteins.},

In addition, a tumour suppressor effect has been suggested for E-cadherin. In human cancers, partial or complete loss of E-cadherin expression correlates with malignancy. To investigate the molecular basis for this altered expression we developed a comprehensive PCR/SSCP mutation screen for the human E-cadherin gene. For 49 breast cancer patients the occurrence of tumour-specific mutations in the E-cadherin gene was examined. No relevant DNA changes were encountered in any of 42 infiltrative ductal or medullary breast carcinoma samples. In contrast, four out of seven infiltrative lobular breast carcinomas harboured protein truncation mutations (three nonsense and one frameshift) in the extracellular part of the E-cadherin protein. Each of the four lobular carcinomas with E-cadherin mutations showed tumour-specific loss of heterozygosity of chromosomal region 16q22.1 containing the E-cadherin locus. In compliance with this, no E-cadherin expression was detectable by immunohistochemistry in these four tumours. These findings offer a molecular explanation for the typical scattered tumour cell growth in infiltrative lobular breast cancer.},

The tumours included 41 infiltrating lobular carcinomas, two infiltrating ducto-lobular carcinomas and six infiltrative ductal carcinomas. In the lobular carcinomas 23 different somatic mutations were detected, of which seven were insertions, 11 deletions, two nonsense mutations and three splice site mutations. The other tumours showed no detectable E-cadherin mutations. All the frameshift and nonsense mutations are expected to generate a secreted E-cadherin fragment instead of a transmembrane protein with cell adhesion activity. The majority of the mutations (21 of 23) were found in combination with loss of heterozygosity of the wild type E-cadherin locus (16q22.1), a hallmark of classical tumour suppressor genes. The mutations were scattered over the whole coding region and no hot spots could be identified. All mutations described here were previously unreported. In conclusion, we have identified up to now E-cadherin mutations in 27 of 48 (56%) infiltrating lobular breast carcinomas and in 0 of 50 breast cancers of other histopathological subtypes. These data provide strong evidence that frequent E-cadherin mutations are involved in the particular etiology of sporadic lobular breast cancers.},

Mutation carriers have a more than 70% lifetime risk of developing DGC and an elevated risk of lobular breast cancer. Intestinal-type gastric cancer is not part of the syndrome. Clinical management of HDGC involves predictive genetic testing beginning at or near 16 years of age. It is recommended that mutation carriers undergo prophylactic gastrectomy after about 20 years of age. Anatomical mapping has demonstrated that mutation carriers develop multifocal stage T1a signet ring cell carcinomas, with up to several hundred foci being observed in single stomachs. These foci develop following the somatic inactivation of the second CDH1 allele by mechanisms that include DNA promoter hypermethylation.},

We report here that E-cadherin expression is absent in six cases of LCIS and present in 150 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), both without an adjacent invasive component. Furthermore, using mutation analysis, we could demonstrate the presence of the same truncating mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type E-cadherin in the LCIS component and in the adjacent ILC.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cell surface glycoprotein E-cadherin (CDH1) is a key regulator of adhesive properties in epithelial cells. Germline mutations in CDH1 are well established as the defects underlying hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome, and an increased risk of lobular breast cancer (LBC) has been described in HDGC kindreds. However, germline CDH1 mutations have not been described in patients with LBC in non-HDGC families. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of germline CDH1 mutations in patients with LBC with early onset disease or family histories of breast cancer without DGC. METHODS: Germline DNA was analysed in 23 women with invasive lobular or mixed ductal and lobular breast cancers who had at least one close relative with breast cancer or had themselves been diagnosed before the age of 45 years, had tested negative for a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, and reported no personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer. The full coding sequence of CDH1 including splice junctions was amplified using PCR and screened for mutations using DHPLC and sequencing. RESULTS: A novel germline CDH1 truncating mutation in the extracellular portion of the protein (517insA) was identified in one woman who had LBC at the age of 42 years and a first degree relative with invasive LBC. CONCLUSIONS: Germline CDH1 mutations can be associated with invasive LBC in the absence of diffuse gastric cancer. The finding, if confirmed, may have implications for management of individuals at risk for this breast cancer subtype. Clarification of the cancer risks in the syndrome is essential.},

Expression patterns of E-cadherin and the molecules comprising the cytoplasmic complex of adherens junctions, alpha-, beta- and gamma-catenin, were studied in a series of 38 lobular breast carcinomas with known E-cadherin mutation status. The effect of loss of E-cadherin by mutational inactivation (or other mechanisms) on the expression of catenins was investigated. Complete loss of plasma membrane-associated E-cadherin expression was observed in 32 out of 38 invasive lobular carcinomas, for which in 21 cases a mutation was found in the extracellular domain of E-cadherin. In total, 15 frameshift mutations of small deletions or insertions, ranging from 1 to 41 bp, three non-sense mutations, and three splice mutations were identified. Mutations were scattered over the whole coding region and no hot spots could be detected. In all cases, simultaneous loss of E-cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenin expression was found; in 50 per cent of these cases, additional loss of gamma-catenin was observed. In six invasive lobular carcinomas, expression of both E-cadherin and catenins was retained. In none of these carcinomas was an E-cadherin mutation detected. Lobular carcinoma in situ adjacent to invasive lobular carcinoma showed simultaneous loss of E-cadherin and catenins in all the cases studied--remarkably, also, in four cases positive for E-cadherin and catenin expression in the invasive component. These results indicate that simultaneous loss of E-cadherin and alpha-, beta- and gamma-catenin may be an important step in the formation of lobular carcinoma in situ, as a precursor of invasive lobular breast cancer. Events additional to E-cadherin inactivation must be involved in the transition of lobular carcinoma in situ to invasive lobular carcinoma.},

   abstract = {Targeting synthetic lethal interactions is a promising new therapeutic approach to exploit specific changes that occur within cancer cells. Multiple approaches to investigate these interactions have been developed and successfully implemented, including chemical, siRNA, shRNA, and CRISPR library screens. Genome-wide computational approaches, such as DAISY, also have been successful in predicting synthetic lethal interactions from both cancer cell lines and patient samples. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered depending on the cancer type and its molecular alterations. This review discusses these approaches and examines case studies that highlight their use.},
